[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

**This repo is a Proof of concept**.

This repo defines a Dockerfile and translation code to extend `workflow.pacta.report` to match the invokation logic for `workflow.transition.monitor`, in hopes that we can support a single docker stack.
